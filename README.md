# QRcodeGenerator

//Important//
This is the source code of my project 'Qrcode Generator'. To use it you must have the modules 'Qrcode' and 'Tkinter(Comes with Python)'
The .exe file is uploaded, but not the orginal python file. The python file will be uploaded after some updates to the application.
The folders which are required to run the .exe file are ".Qrcodes" and ".RuntimeLib". You can delete all other files.

//Usage//
After oppening the "Gen.exe" file (With the required folder) you will get a Application Screen(GUI). Type in the text on to the text input block. Then click generate to generate a qrcode representing the text you typed in the input block(The file will be saved to the folder(.Qrcodes)).
